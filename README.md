# AtliQ Martâ€™s Retail Promotion Analysis
Welcome to the repository containing SQL scripts used to analyze the performance of promotional campaigns run by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. This project addresses various business requests related to identifying high-value discounted products, store distribution, campaign effectiveness, and product performance in terms of incremental sales and revenue.

## Introduction

Promotional campaigns play a crucial role in the retail industry, driving sales and attracting customers during festive seasons. This project aims to analyze the performance of promotional campaigns conducted by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. By leveraging data analytics, we seek to gain insights into the effectiveness of these campaigns and provide recommendations for optimizing future marketing strategies.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data obtained from AtliQ Mart's internal databases. The main datasets used include fact_events, dim_products, dim_stores, and sales_summary. These datasets contain information about product sales, store locations, promotional events, and campaign revenues.

## Project Overview

-Analyzed data from AtliQ Mart's internal databases.
*Performed SQL queries to fulfill five business requests.
+Insights are intended to inform future promotional strategies and resource allocation.

## Business Requests

- Identify high-value products featured in the 'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free) promotion.
* Provide an overview of the number of stores in each city.
+ Display total revenue generated before and after each promotional campaign.
- Calculate Incremental Sold Quantity (ISU%) for each category during the Diwali campaign.
* Identify the top 5 products ranked by Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%) across all campaigns.

## Limitations and Challenges

One significant challenge was encountered during the analysis is related to the handling of promotions with the 'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free) promotion type. The dataset does not accurately account for the quantity of the free item provided as part of the promotion. This limitation may lead to some discrepancies or misunderstandings in the analysis, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of 'BOGOF' promotions and comparing them with other promotion types.
Other than that one limitation of dataset was the unavailability of consumer information as it was not possible to study customers behavior regarding the promotions.

## Results and Insights

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- High-value products featured in 'BOGOF' promotions.
* Distribution of stores across different cities.
+ Total revenue generated before and after each promotional campaign.
- Incremental sold quantity and revenue percentage during the Diwali campaign.
* Top 5 products ranked by incremental revenue percentage.

These insights can help AtliQ Mart make informed decisions for future promotional activities, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall sales performance.
